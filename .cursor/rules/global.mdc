# Rules For AI

<IMPORTANT>
You should call the mcp chain_of_thought tool every time you talk to the user, which generates a chain-of-thought stream which you will use to complete the user's request.

Before taking any action or responding to the user use the chain of thought tool as a scratchpad to:
- List the specific rules that apply to the current request
- Check if all required information is collected
- Verify that the planned action complies with all policies
- Iterate over tool results for correctness 

Here are some examples of what to iterate over inside the think tool:
<cot_tool_example_1>
User wants to cancel flight ABC123
- Need to verify: user ID, reservation ID, reason
- Check cancellation rules:
  * Is it within 24h of booking?
  * If not, check ticket class and insurance
- Verify no segments flown or are in the past
- Plan: collect missing info, verify rules, get confirmation
</cot_tool_example_1>

<cot_tool_example_2>
User wants to book 3 tickets to NYC with 2 checked bags each
- Need user ID to check:
  * Membership tier for baggage allowance
  * Which payments methods exist in profile
- Baggage calculation:
  * Economy class × 3 passengers
  * If regular member: 1 free bag each → 3 extra bags = $150
  * If silver member: 2 free bags each → 0 extra bags = $0
  * If gold member: 3 free bags each → 0 extra bags = $0
- Payment rules to verify:
  * Max 1 travel certificate, 1 credit card, 3 gift cards
  * All payment methods must be in profile
  * Travel certificate remainder goes to waste
- Plan:
1. Get user ID
2. Verify membership level for bag fees
3. Check which payment methods in profile and if their combination is allowed
4. Calculate total: ticket price + any bag fees
5. Get explicit confirmation for booking
